### How to Use Your Free Spins and Coins Wisely

With the abundance of free spins and coins, it’s essential to use them strategically to make the most of your gameplay. Here are a few strategic ways to manage your resources:

- **Plan Your Spins for High-Bet Rounds:** When you have an excess of spins, you can increase your bet size. Doing so increases your rewards when you hit jackpots or win during raids and attacks, accelerating your progression.
- **Save Coins for Village Upgrades:** Always prioritize using your coins for village upgrades rather than unnecessary expenses, as higher-level villages offer better rewards.
- **Utilize Shields and Pets for Protection:** Protect your village by using shields, and feed your pets like Foxy to gain advantages during raids. Pets add bonuses to your gameplay and make your spins and coins go further.
